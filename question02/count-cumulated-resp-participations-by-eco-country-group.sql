-- AUTHORS WITH MULTIPLE PARTICIPATIONS
-- Q2. Who are the authors that have participated
--     in more than 1, 2, 3, or 4 assessment reports
--     while holding at least 1 of the 3 elected roles in the IPCC
--     in each assessment report of participation
--     (Coordinating Lead Author, Lead Author, Review Editor)?

-- RESP = authors with a role of responsibility (LA, CLA or RE)
--        in EVERY assessment report of participation

-- IN EACH ECO (Economic) COUNTRY GROUP,
-- count the RESP authors who contributed to:
-- * 1+ assessment reports
-- * 2+ assessment reports
-- * 3+ assessment reports
-- * 4+ assessment reports
-- * 5  assessment reports
