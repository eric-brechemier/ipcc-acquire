-- AUTHORS WITH MULTIPLE PARTICIPATIONS
-- Q2. Who are the authors that have participated
--     in more than 1, 2, 3, or 4 assessment reports

--     (Coordinating Lead Author, Lead Author, Review Editor)?

-- RESP = authors with a role of responsibility (LA, CLA or RE)
--        in EVERY assessment report of participation

-- FOR EACH INSTITUTION,
-- count the percentage of RESP authors who contributed to:
-- * 1+ assessment reports
-- * 2+ assessment reports
-- * 3+ assessment reports
-- * 4+ assessment reports
-- * 5  assessment reports
-- relative to the total number of RESP authors who contributed
-- to a number of assessment reports in the same range
-- for any given INSTITUTION
